.. title:: FEniCS Form Compiler


FEniCS Form Compiler (FFC)
==========================

This is the documentation for the FEniCS Form Compiler (FFC) from the
FEniCS Project (http://fenicsproject.org).  FFC is a compiler for
finite element variational forms. From a high-level description of the
form, it generates efficient low-level C++ code that can be used to
assemble the corresponding discrete operator (tensor). In particular,
a bilinear form may be assembled into a matrix and a linear form may
be assembled into a vector
