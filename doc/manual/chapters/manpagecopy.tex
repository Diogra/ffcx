\end{code}

\section{Description}

The FEniCS Form Compiler FFC accepts as input one or more files each
specifying one or more multilinear forms and compiles the given forms
into efficent low-level code for automatic assembly of the tensors
representing the multilinear forms. In particular, FFC compiles a pair
of bilinear and linear forms defining a variational problem into code
that can be used to efficiently assemble the corresponding linear
system.

By default, FFC generates C++ code for DOLFIN, but this can be
changed by specifying a different output language (option -l).
It is also possible to add new output languages to FFC.

\section{Options}

\subsection{\texttt{-h, --help}}

Display help text and exit.

\subsection{\texttt{-v, --version}}

Display version number and exit.

\subsection{\texttt{-l language, --language language}}

Specify output language, one of 
\texttt{dolfin} (default),
\texttt{latex},
\texttt{raw},
\texttt{ase} or
\texttt{xml}.

\subsection{\texttt{-d debuglevel, --debug debuglevel}}

Specify debug level (default is \texttt{0}).

\subsection{\texttt{-f option}}

Specify code generation options. The list of options available depends
on the specified language (format). Current options include
\texttt{-f no-gpl} and
\texttt{-f blas}
described in detail below.

\subsection{\texttt{-f no-gpl}}

Don't add GPL license to generated code. This option has only effect
when compiling with \texttt{-ldolfin}.

\subsection{\texttt{-f blas}}

Generate code that uses BLAS to compute tensor products. This option
has only effect when compiling with \texttt{-ldolfin}.
