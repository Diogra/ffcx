FFC follows the standard procedure for installation of Python packages.
As root, run

        python setup.py install

This will install FFC in the default Python path of your system,
probably in /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/.

The installation script requires the Python module distutils,
which for Debian users is available with the python-dev package.
