Test structure:

  unit/          - unit tests of internal components of uflacs
  crosslanguage/ - unit tests which produce C++ tests of generated code which is then executed by gtest
  system/        - tests that use external software with uflacs, in particular integration with dolfin

Build gtest:

  cd ../libs/gtest-1.7.0/   # This is a copy of the Google Test Framework.
  mkdir lib
  cd lib
  cmake ..
  make

Running examples:

  cd test/
  py.test
  py.test unit
  py.test system
  py.test crosslanguage
