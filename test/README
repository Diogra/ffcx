Test structure:

  unit/          - unit tests of internal components of uflacs
  crosslanguage/ - unit tests which produce C++ tests of generated code which is then executed by gtest
  system/        - tests that use external software with uflacs, in particular integration with dolfin

Running examples:

  cd test/
  py.test
  py.test unit
  py.test system
  py.test crosslanguage
