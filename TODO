This file lists TODO items for FFC. As usual, the priority depends
on the current interests of the various FFC developers. To edit this
file, it is convenient to install org-mode in Emacs.

* Write introduction in manual
  - The introduction is currently empty

* Write about a, L, M in manual
  - Missing in current manual

* Write about lhs() and rhs() in manual

* Projections
  - Reimplement (worked before)
  - Add to manual

* Optimization
  - Reimplement (worked before)
  - Write about optimizations in manual
  - Add to man page

* BLAS mode
  - Reimplement level 2 BLAS (worked before)
  - Implement level 3 BLAS
  - Generate loops for geometry tensor
  - Add to man page

* Generate loops for geometry tensor in BLAS mode
  - It should be possible to reduce the size of the generated code
  for complicated forms by generating loops for the computation of
  the entries of the geometry tensor

* UFC, Implement missing functions
  - evaluate_basis_all()
  - evaluate_basis_derivatives_all()
  - evaluate_dofs()
  - num_entity_dofs()
  - tabulate_entity_dofs()

* Time derivatives
  - Dt(u)

* Quad elements
  - Isoparametric mapping

* Tensor-valued functions

* Fix all FIXMEs
  - There are a few of these: find src/ffc -name '*.py' | xargs grep FIXME

* Conversion to UFL
  - Skipping factorization in tensor representation, does it matter?
    Check speed against old FFC.
  - Estimation of quadrature_order not correct in UFL

* Conversion status

  ?  = Unknown
  -  = Shouldn't work
  x  = Does not compile
  c  = Compiles
  C  = Compiles and looks ok
  OK = Works perfectly

Notes Quadr:
x  - Only Lagrange, Discontinuous Lagrange and Quadrature elements are supported
     for now
OK - Code is not very efficient
** - Due to the difference in how tensor and quadrature applies function
     operators the norm when comparing two tensors is around 1.3e-1
