The following list of items will or should be fixed in future versions
of FFC. The items are listed in approximate order of priority.

* Fix bug in RT1
  - RT elements work for q = 0, 2, 3 but not for q = 1

* Write introduction in manual
  - The introduction is currently empty

* Projections
  - Reimplement (worked before)
  - Add to manual

* Optimization
  - Reimplement (worked before)
  - Write about optimizations in manual
  - Add to man page

* BLAS mode
  - Reimplement (worked before)
  - Add to man page

* Facet integrals for Piola-mapped elements
  - Not implemented, should be "easy" to fix

* Picking Piola components of nested mixed elements

* BDM/RT elements in 3D
  - Add missing pieces to get BDM and RT elements work
  in 3D (they mostly work in 2D)

* Optionally generate a pair of .h and .cpp files
  - FFC currently only generates a single .h file. The UFC
  utils provides a simple way to organize the code in .cpp
  and or .h files, but FFC does not yet use this.
  - Add to man page

* Display flop count
  - The flop count for evaluation of the element tensor should
  be printed during compilation

* Generate loops for geometry tensor in BLAS mode
  - It should be possible to reduce the size of the generated code
  for complicated forms by generating loops for the computation of
  the entries of the geometry tensor

* Just-in-time compilation
  - Use Instant to compile and wrap code back to Python

* Fix all FIXMEs
  - There are a few of these: find src/ffc -name '*.py' | xargs grep FIXME
