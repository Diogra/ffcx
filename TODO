This file lists TODO items for FFC. As usual, the priority depends
on the current interests of the various FFC developers. To edit this
file, it is convenient to install org-mode in Emacs.

* Conversion to UFL
  - Skipping factorization in tensor representation, does it matter?
    Check speed against old FFC.
  - Use DOLFIN wrappers from dolfin_utils
  - Use load_form_file from UFL
  - Clean out old unused code (check coverage)
    
* Write introduction in manual
  - The introduction is currently empty

# Should this also be in UFL?
* Projections
  - Reimplement (worked before)
  - Add to manual

* Optimization
  - Reimplement (worked before)
  - Write about optimizations in manual
  - Add to man page

* BLAS mode
  - Reimplement level 2 BLAS (worked before)
  - Implement level 3 BLAS
  - Generate loops for geometry tensor
  - Add to man page

* Generate loops for geometry tensor in BLAS mode
  - It should be possible to reduce the size of the generated code
  for complicated forms by generating loops for the computation of
  the entries of the geometry tensor

* UFC, Implement missing functions
  - evaluate_basis_all()
  - evaluate_basis_derivatives_all()
  - evaluate_dofs()
  - num_entity_dofs()
  - tabulate_entity_dofs()

* Quad elements
  - Isoparametric mapping

* Fix all FIXMEs
  - There are a few of these: find src/ffc -name '*.py' | xargs grep FIXME
