This file lists TODO items and suggested interface changes for UFC.

To edit this file, it is convenient to install org-mode in Emacs.
It is available as part of Emacs 22 and can be invoked by M-x org-mode.
This gives convenient expand/collapse of bullets by pressing TAB.

* Suggestions for UFC 1.2
** Add dof_map::topological_dimension()
** Add foo_integral::tabulate_tensors()

* Features to possibly include in future versions
** Adding dimensions to ufc::function for consistency checks?
** Support for true constants (now handled as piecewise constants),
   to avoid overhead in tabulate_dof_map and filling of w[][] when
   there are many constant coefficients.
** Different number of coefficients for each integral,
   to avoid overhead in tabulate_dof_map and filling of w[][] when
   there are many separate coefficients.
** Support for mixed cell meshes and different elements on cells (p-adaptivity)?
** High order geometry support in cell (does this require more than "simply" defining high order reference cells?)
** Various functions in class form and/or others, returning std::string's with readable names and descriptions.
   How much to include can of course be discussed. Missing items can simply return "".
