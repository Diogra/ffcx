Things todo
-------------

* Get basic 1D in 3D working: need testing
* Get basic 2D in 3D working: need jacobians and inverses
* Get exterior_facet integrals running
* Get geometric entities going (normals for 1D-in-3D might not be trivial)
* Get interior_facet integrals running
* Get H(curl)/H(div) elements running
* Get mixed elements running
* Run all 2D/3D demos with tdim = gdim - 1
