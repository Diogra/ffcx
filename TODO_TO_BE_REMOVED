Things to get running
---------------------

[x] * Get basic 1D in 2D working with optimized quadrature.
[x] * Get exterior_facet integrals running
[ ] * Get geometric entities going (normals for 1D-in-3D might not be trivial)
[x] * Get interior_facet integrals running
[x] * Get H(curl)/H(div) elements running
[x] * Get mixed elements running
[ ] * Run all 2D/3D demos with tdim = gdim - 1

Things to test
---------------

[ ] * Test all the above
