FFC: The FEniCS Form Compiler
-----------------------------

FFC is a compiler for finite element variational forms. From a high-level
description of the form, it generates efficient low-level C++ code that
can be used to assemble the corresponding discrete operator (tensor). In
particular, a bilinear form may be assembled into a matrix and a linear
form may be assembled into a vector.

FFC may be used either from the command line (by invoking the 'ffc' command)
or as a Python module ('import ffc').

FFC is part of the FEniCS project (www.fenics.org) and functions as a
just-in-time (JIT) compiler for DOLFIN.

For further introduction to FFC, open the FFC user manual available in
