1. Introduction

UFC (Unified Form-assembly Code) is a unified framework for finite
element assembly. More precisely, it defines a fixed interface for
communicating low level routines (functions) for evaluating and
assembling finite element variational forms. The UFC interface
consists of a single header file ufc.h that specifies a C++ interface
that must be implemented by code that complies with the UFC
specification. Examples of form compilers that support the UFC
interface are FFC and SyFi. For more information, visit the UFC web
page at

    http://www.fenics.org/ufc/

or refer to the UFC Specification and User Manual in

    doc/manual/ufc-user-manual.pdf

in this source tree.

2. Installation

To install UFC, simply run

    sudo python setup.py install

This installs the header file ufc.h and a small set of Python
utils (templates) for generating UFC code.

Alternatively, just copy the single header file src/ufc/ufc.h
into a suitable include directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. License

The header file ufc.h and UFC Python utils are released into
the public domain.
